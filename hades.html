        <p class="p3"> Hades is the Greek god of the dead, the ruler of the underworld. 
            He was given the underworld while his brother <a href="/zeus.html">Zeus</a> was given the sky and his 
            brother <a href="/index.html">Posideon</a> was given the sea. He's the oldest son of <a href="/cronus.html">Cronus</a> and Rhea, and
            is also associated with great riches. He possesses the Cap of
            Invisibility, which allowed him to become invisible though a magic
            helmet.
            Hades' sacred animals were the Screech Owl, the Serpents, and the Black Rams.
            Hades' Roman counterpart is Pluto, and his weapon of choice is the bident, a 
            two-pronged implement.
