        <p> Poseidon is a hot-blooded deity who is often depicted 
            wielding a trident. He is the second son of <A HREF="/cronus.html">Cronus</A> and Rhea,
            and was swallowed by Cronus at birth. The god of the sea, storms,
            earthquakes, and horses. His Roman equivalent is Neptune.

            With the defeat of his father Cronos, Poseidon was given the sea,
            while his brothers,  <A HREF="/zeus.html">Zeus</A> and <A HREF="/hades.html">Hades</A>, were given the sky and underworld
            respectively.
