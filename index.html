        <h1>Greek God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses: Poseidon</h1>
        <p>Poseidon is the son of Cronus, a Titan, 
            and the brother of Zeus and Hades. After 
            Cronus was defeated by the three, the sea 
            was under rule of Poseidon, with Zeus and 
            Hades getting the sky and underworld respectively.
