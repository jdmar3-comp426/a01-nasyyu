        <p class = "p2"> Zeus is a sky and weather god who is identical to Jupiter,
            the Roman god. His traditional weapon was the thunderbolt.
            He is the king of Mount Olympus, which is the home of the Greek
            gods, and he was the last child of <A HREF="/cronus.html">Cronus</A> and Rhea. He ruled the sky 
            while his brother <A HREF="/index.html">Posideon</A> ruled the sea and 
            his brother <A HREF="/hades.html">Hades</A> ruled the underworld.

            Zeus fell in love easily and made love to many women, mortal
            and immortal alike. He would punish anybody who attempted to 
            escort his wife, Hera, however.
